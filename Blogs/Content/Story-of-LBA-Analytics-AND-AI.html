    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      At <strong>LBA Analytics and AI</strong>, we’re not just building data professionals—we’re building a revolution from India’s grassroots. We are a mentorship-first platform designed to make <strong>Data Analytics education truly accessible</strong>, regardless of one’s background, college, or financial capacity.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-4">From a Small Village Dream to a Nationwide Mission</h2>
    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Our story begins in a small village in Bihar. Our founder, <strong>Durgesh</strong>, completed his early education through hostel life and district schools. With 69% in 10th from BSEB and a diploma from TPSBE & IT Chandigarh, he went on to earn a <strong>B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering</strong>. Like many, he followed the traditional path—interning and working with reputed companies like <strong>MEGHA Engineering</strong> and <strong>Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories</strong> as a Junior Engineer.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      But something was missing.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Despite stable roles, he found himself uninspired by the work and disconnected from his purpose. This sparked a radical shift. With limited resources but unlimited resolve, Durgesh took a bold step—<strong>investing ₹5,00,000 into upskilling himself in Data Analytics</strong>, driven entirely by loans and belief. He faced rejection, uncertainty, and financial pressure—but also transformation.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Today, he’s turned that experience into a mission:
      <em>"Nobody should have to go into debt to change their life. We make sure you can upskill in Data Analytics with just your first salary—or even less."</em>
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-4">Our Purpose</h2>
    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      <strong>LBA Analytics and AI</strong> was created for the <strong>dreamers in Tier 3 colleges</strong>, the <strong>mothers restarting their careers</strong>, the <strong>non-IT professionals</strong>, and the <strong>college students who know they deserve better</strong>. We are committed to turning every data dream into a data career—through mentorship, not just modules.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-4">Our Core Beliefs</h2>

      <li><strong>Learning and mastering</strong> are two different things. We don’t just teach skills—we make you <em>job-ready masters</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Education must be affordable and practical.</strong> If it doesn’t bring results, it’s not education.</li>
      <li><strong>Opportunity should not be limited by geography or background.</strong> From a village in Bihar to a bank in Mumbai—data is the great equalizer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-4">Our Programs</h2>

    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      <li>A mother with a multi-year <strong>career gap</strong> is now thriving as a <strong>Product Analyst</strong>.</li>
      <li>A struggling aspirant with a long <strong>employment gap</strong> landed a <strong>Data Analyst</strong> job.</li>
      <li>A <strong>non-tech background</strong> candidate got placed in a <strong>Banking Data Analyst</strong> role.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      These are not just success stories. They are proof of what’s possible when education meets empathy.
